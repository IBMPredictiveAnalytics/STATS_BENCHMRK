<h1>Benchmark Statistics Jobs</h1>
This command runs one or two syntax files one or more times
and records various statistics on computer resource consumption.

<p><span class="runinhead">Syntax file to benchmark</span> 
Select a syntax file to be benchmarked.

<p><span class="runinhead">Alternate syntax file for comparison</span> Optionally
select another syntax file to be run in alternation with the first one.  This is useful
when you have two version of syntax and want to compare their resource use.

<p><span class="runinhead">Processes to Measure</span> Check boxes for the
Statistics processes to be measured.  These can be the Statistics frontend, the
backend, and the Python and R programmability processes.
<p class="bullet">&bull; The names of the processes vary some among
Statistics versions.  If you cannot specify a process you want to monitor,
paste the syntax and edit the name.

<p><span class="runinhead">Start the R process</span> The R process must
be started before running the benchmark command if it is to be measured.  Check this box if that process
has not been started, and you want the dialog box to do this.  
<p class="bullet">&bull; If the R Essentials are not installed, do not check this box.

<p><span class="runinhead">Output File to Create</span> Specify a file name
to receive the recorded statistics.  The file will be in csv format and can be read
using File>Read Text Data.  It will contain variable names on the first line.
The variables include the process name, the cmdset, and the repetition number and the statistics values
at the start and stop of each syntax file run.  There is one record for each process.

<p><span class="runinhead">Number of repetitions</span> Specify the number of
times that the syntax files should be run.

<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>Choose the particular statistics to be measured each time a syntax file is run.
<p><span class="runinhead">All statistics</span> Check this box to generate all
available statistics.  
<p class="bullet">&bull; The other checkboxes are ignored if this box is checked.
<p class="bullet">&bull;  Checking this box generates some statistics not listed
elsewhere in this dialog.

<p><span class="runinhead">Time</span> The total time for a job is the
sum of the User and Kernel time.  The process creation time is often not
meaningful.
<p><span class="runinhead">I/O</span> In addition to the number of reads
and writes, by using syntax the bytes counts are also available.

<p><span class="runinhead">Memory</span> The working set size tells
you the number of pages in the process' memory.  The page fault statistics
tell you how many times the system had to retrieve code and other resources from disk because
it was not in memory when needed.

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>
This dialog generates syntax for the STATS BENCHMRK extension command. To display help for this command,
run the following syntax:
</p>
<p class="codeblock">STATS BENCHMRK /HELP.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
This command requires the Python Essentials, the Python Windows extensions,
and the STATS BENCHMRK extension command.  You can get the Python Windows
extensions from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32">Sourceforge</a>.
Be sure to get the version appropriate for the version of Python required by Statistics.
You can download the other materials from the
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/spssdevcentral">SPSS Community</a>.
