STATS BENCHMRK Extension Command
================================

Benchmark one or two sets of syntax and report selected resource usage
statistics.


STATS BENCHMRK CMDSET1="*file*"^&#42;
CMDSET2="*filespec*"  
NUMREP=n 
PROCESSES=*process name list*^&#42;

/OUTPUT OUTFILE="*csv-file*^&#42;  
STATISTICS=*list of statistics*^&#42;

/HELP

^&#42; Required  
^&#42;&#42; Default
    
/HELP displays this text and does nothing else.

Example:
```
STATS BENCHMRK CMDSET1="C:\jobs\insert1.sps" 
NUMREP=3  PROCESSES=stats spssengine startx startx32
/OUTPUT OUTFILE="c:\temp\bench.csv" 
STATISTICS=UserTime KernelTime  PageFaultCount PeakWorkingSetSize WorkingSetSize.
```

This command is available only for Windows and requires the Python for Windows extensions by Mark Hammond
available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
Be sure to get the version appropriate for the version of Python required by
Statistics.

**CMDSET1** and **CMDSET2** specify syntax files to be run repeatedly in
alternation.  CMDSET2 is optional.  Using two command sets is
useful when you have two alternative versions of syntax for the same
task and want to determine which is  more efficient.

**NUMREP** specifies how many times to run the cmdsets.  It defaults to 1.  For each rep, CMDSET1
is run and then, if given, CMDSET2 is run.

**PROCESSES** specifies one or more processes to monitor.
Statistics are recorded for each specified process associated with Statistics.
The process names may vary with the Statistics version.  For V22, they are
* stats - the Statistics frontend
* spssengine - the Statistics backend
* startx - the Python process and the R process

Some older versions use  
startx32 - the R process.

The R process must be started before running this command if it is to be
monitored.

OUTPUT
------
**OUTFILE** names a csv file to contain the benchmark statistics.  Each case
includes process, command set, and repetition identifiers along with each
statistic measured at the start and end of the syntax execution.

**STATISTICS** lists the statistics to be collected.  Use ALL to get every one.
Otherwise select from this list.  See the Task Manager process help for
definitions.  Availability and exact name may vary with the Windows version
